# Introduction to Containers workshop

<section>

Hello and welcome to our @tutor workshop! We are very happy to have you here.

This is the @edition edition of this workshop, jointly organised by VIB and ELIXIR.

> We are using the interactive Open Educational Resource online/offline course infrastructure called LiaScript.
> It is a distributed way of creating and sharing educational content hosted on github.
> To see this document as an interactive LiaScript rendered version, click on the
> following link/badge: [LiaScript](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vibbits/containers-workshop/main/README.md)

## General context

This repository contains the materials (exercises) for the workshop on containers of May 20, 2021. We will focus on Docker and Singularity.
Subsequent editions have taken place in January and October 2022 and March 2023, October 2023 and February 2024.

Some exercises are inspired upon the examples from [Microsoft Azure ML github repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples). The content of this repo is licensed with MIT license.

Other exercises are co-created with the [Code Reproducibility team of the ELIXIR network](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/CodeReproducibility)

> <i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i> **Prerequisites**  
> To be able to follow this course, learners should have knowledge in:
> 
> 1. Knowledge of Command line Interface is a plus  
>
> <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> **Description** The course will give an introduction to containers (Docker & Apptainer) which are great components to achieve portability and reproducibility of your analysis. You will learn how to use containers and how to build a container from scratch, share it with others and how to re-use and modify existing containers. After an extensive explanation on Docker containers, the Apptainer application, previously Singularity, and its use in the HPC will be highlighted as well.

# About us

*About ELIXIR Training Platform*

The ELIXIR Training Platform was established to develop a training community that spans all ELIXIR member states (see the list of Training Coordinators). It aims to strengthen national training programmes, grow bioinformatics training capacity and competence across Europe, and empower researchers to use ELIXIR's services and tools.

One service offered by the Training Platform is TeSS, the training registry for the ELIXIR community. Together with ELIXIR France and ELIXIR Slovenia, VIB as lead node for ELIXIR Belgium is engaged in consolidating quality and impact of the TeSS training resources (2022-23) (https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/2022-trp3).

The Training eSupport System was developed to help trainees, trainers and their institutions to have a one-stop shop where they can share and find information about training and events, including training material. This way we can create a catalogue that can be shared within the community. How it works is what we are going to find out in this course.

*About VIB and VIB Technologies*

VIB is an entrepreneurial non-profit research institute, with a clear focus on groundbreaking strategic basic research in life sciences and operates in close partnership with the five universities in Flanders – Ghent University, KU Leuven, University of Antwerp, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Hasselt University.

As part of the VIB Technologies, the 12 VIB Core Facilities, provide support in a wide array of research fields and housing specialized scientific equipment for each discipline. Science and technology go hand in hand. New technologies advance science and often accelerate breakthroughs in scientific research. VIB has a visionary approach to science and technology, founded on its ability to identify and foster new innovations in life sciences.

The goal of VIB Technology Training is to up-skill life scientists to excel in the domains of VIB Technologies, Bioinformatics & AI, Software Development, and Research Data Management.
