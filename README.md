# Containers workshop
This repository contains the materials (exercises) for the workshop on containers of May 20, 2021. We will focus on Docker and Singularity.
Subsequent editions have taken place in January and October 2022 and March 2023, October 2023 and February 2024.

Some exercises are inspired upon the examples from [Microsoft Azure ML github repo](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples). The content of this repo is licensed with MIT license.

Other exercises are co-created with the [Code Reproducibility team of the ELIXIR network](https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/CodeReproducibility)
