- **Transcript**: This exercise is based on a video tutorial on how to build a machine learning app with a model from Hugging Face, FastAPI, and Docker.

- **Model**: The model is a vision and language transformer that can process both images and text, and answer questions related to the image content. 
The model code uses the Transformers library and PyTorch.

- **FastAPI**: FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python. It supports type annotations, automatic documentation, file upload, and async functions. 
The tutorial shows how to create a FastAPI app that calls the model pipeline function and returns the answer as a JSON response.

- **Docker**: Docker is a tool for creating and running containers that isolate applications and their dependencies. 
The tutorial shows how to use the docker init command to generate a Dockerfile, a docker-compose file, and a .dockerignore file. 
The Dockerfile installs the requirements, copies the code, and runs the uvicorn command to start the FastAPI app. 
The docker-compose file simplifies the process of building and running the container.
